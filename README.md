# Linux Shell Script (D0025N - Assignment)

A shell script written in connection with the course D0025N - Data
Communication in Information Systems, using the concepts listed below:

### Shebang
- **Description**: Use a shebang (`#!`) at the beginning of the script to specify the interpreter, such as `#!/bin/bash`.
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the script is executed using the specified shell.

### Variables
- **Description**: Declare and use variables to store and manipulate data.
- **Usage**: Variables hold data values and can be used throughout the script.

### Input/Output
- **Description**: Learn how to read user input and display output using `read` and `echo` commands.
- **Usage**: `read` captures user input; `echo` displays text or variable content.

### Conditionals
- **Description**: Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for decision-making in scripts.
- **Usage**: Enables scripts to execute different code blocks based on certain conditions.

### Loops
- **Description**: Understand `for` and `while` loops for repetitive tasks in scripts.
- **Usage**: Loops allow repetitive execution of code blocks until a condition is met.

### Functions
- **Description**: Define and call functions to organize code and make it reusable.
- **Usage**: Functions encapsulate code for specific tasks, making scripts more modular.

### File Handling
- **Description**: Learn basic file operations, such as reading from and writing to files.
- **Usage**: Essential for scripts that require data persistence or file manipulation.

### Command-Line Arguments
- **Description**: Handle command-line arguments passed to a script using `$1`, `$2`, etc.
- **Usage**: Allows passing of parameters into a script, enhancing its flexibility.

### Error Handling
- **Description**: Implement error handling with `trap` and `exit` to manage unexpected situations.
- **Usage**: Crucial for robust scripts, ensuring they handle errors gracefully.

### Comments
- **Description**: Use comments (`#`) to add explanations and documentation to your scripts.
